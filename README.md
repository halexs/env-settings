# env-settings
This is generic environment settings for development.

# How to Use
Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/halexs/env-settings.git
cd env-settings
./env_import.sh
```
Generic imports will be done in repo, and will automatically be sourced.

The following sections can still be done, but no longer necessary.

For ctags, need to run `./env_import.sh` script everytime. No idea how to source ctags.

Current ctags work with typescript/angular.
